An absurb little project for easily creating images for blog posts with other images from the internet. See [this post](http://mrdanadams.com/2011/logo-lifter-launched-for-easier-creation-of-blog-post-featured-images/) for the announcement and why it was made.

The site is static and served from a CDN. Feel free to make contributions. I'll take care of deploying changes after a pull request.

Markup changes should go in `index-dev.html`.

I suggest using pow.cx to work on it locally.
